Only post an issue here if you think you discovered a bug or have a feature request._\n\n* * *\n\n**Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start working on Dropzone!**\n\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/releases/latest\"><strong>&gt;&gt; Download &lt;&lt;</strong></a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\nStarting with version 2.0.0 this library does no longer depend on jQuery (but\nit still works as a jQuery module).\n\nDropzone is compatible with [component](https://github.com/component/component),\nthere's a standalone version and an [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)\nmodule that's compatible with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) in the downloads\nfolder.\n\n<img slt=\"Dropzone Screenshot\" width=\"585\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Xf7QvVG.png\" />\n\n\n\n## Main features\n\n- Image thumbnail previews. Simply register the callback `thumbnail(file, data)` and display the image wherever you like\n- Retina enabled\n- Multiple files and synchronous uploads\n- Progress updates\n- Support for large files\n- Complete theming. The look and feel of Dropzone is just the default theme. You\n  can define everything yourself by overwriting the default event listeners.\n- Well tested\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor the full documentation and installation please visit www.dropzonejs.com\n\nPlease also refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki/FAQ).\n\n## Examples\n\nFor examples, please see the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki).\n\n## Usage\n\nImplicit creation:\n\n```html\n<form id=\"my-awesome-dropzone\" action=\"/target\" class=\"dropzone\"></form>\n```\n\nThat's it. Really!\n\nDropzone will automatically attach to it, and handle file drops.\n\nWant more control? You can configure dropzones like this:\n\n```js\n// \"myAwesomeDropzone\" is the camelized version of the ID of your HTML element\nDropzone.options.myAwesomeDropzone = { maxFilesize: 1 };\n```\n\n...or instantiate dropzone manually like this:\n\n```js\nnew Dropzone(\"div#my-dropzone\", { /* options */ });\n```\n\n> Note that dropzones don't have to be forms. But if you choose another element you have to pass the `url` parameter in the options.\n\nFor configuration options please look at the [documentation on the website](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration)\nor at the [source](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/master/src/dropzone.coffee#L90).\n\n\n\n### Register for events\n\nIf you want to register to some event you can do so on the `dropzone` object itself:\n\n```js\nDropzone.options.myDropzone({\n  init: function() {\n    this.on(\"error\", function(file, message) { alert(message); });\n  }\n});\n// or if you need to access a Dropzone somewhere else:\nvar myDropzone = Dropzone.forElement(\"div#my-dropzone\");\nmyDropzone.on(\"error\", function(file, message) { alert(message); });\n```\n\nFor a list of all events, please look at the chapter \n[»listen to events«](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#listen_to_events) in the documentation\nor at the [source](src/dropzone.coffee#L43).\n\n\n## Browser support\n\n- Chrome 7+\n- Firefox 4+\n- IE 10+\n- Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy)\n- Safari 6+\n\nFor all the other browsers, dropzone provides an oldschool file input fallback.\n\n## Why another library?\n\nI realize that there [are](http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) [already](http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/) [other](http://code.google.com/p/html5uploader/) [libraries](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/) out there but the reason I decided to write my own are the following:\n\n- I didn't want it to be too big, and to cumbersome to dive into.\n- I want to design my own elements. I only want to register callbacks so I can update my elements accordingly.\n- Big files should get uploaded without a problem.\n- I wanted a callback for image previews, that don't kill the browser if too many too big images are viewed.\n- I want to use the latest API of browsers. I don't care if it falls back to the normal upload form if the browser is too old.\n- I don't think that it's necessary anymore to depend on libraries such as jQuery (especially when providing functionality that isn't available in old browsers anyway).\n\nMIT License\n-----------\n\nSee LICENSE file\n",
